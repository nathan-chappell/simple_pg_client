## "Compilers"

The compilers are typically doing simple and low-level text manipulation

* Line: compiles to a line of text.  Considers alignment and indentation
* Table: compiles to many lines of text based on given "rows" and "widths"
* TextCompiler: essentially the text-engine of the application for now.
